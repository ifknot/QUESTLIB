Tables to the rescue 

	ID  	owner	description	N S E W U D	Properties
root	0						00000000
player	1	1					01011000
rm1	2				2		10100010
rm2 	3				  1	  	10011001
lamp	4	0					00001110	

But... We need lots of tables 

Articles	Prepositions	Dictionary	Token-Verbs 	
a		in		old		0 get
an		on		rusty		0 take
the		under		iron		0 pick up
		over		sword		1 look at
		at		box		2 examine
		with		strange		3 inspect

*Object-Word-Table* maps word table to items rusty-iron-lamp via rusty or iron or lamp to item id 5 
id 5 looks up the data for item and describes or changes ownership etc 

*Jump Table* maps user input to subroutines

verb#	direct obj#	preposition#	indirect obj# 	subroutine
kill	troll		with		sword		attack_troll_with_sword
eat	cake		255		255		eat_cake
eat 	254		255		255		eat_inedible

255=nothing	254= anything

*String Tables* (names, descriptions, messages, etc)   
id 	length	stringz
